        {
            "id": "J69H07BDS8G11RDF01E96CW660",
            "channel_identities": [
                {
                    "channel": "MESSENGER",
                    "identity": "7746490198930851",
                    "app_id": "3FDS0PWWERGN1QX101E75WGS3Y"
                }
            ],
            "channel_priority": [
                "MESSENGER",
            ],
            "display_name": "",
            "email": "",
            "external_id": "",

    "app_id": "{{YOUR_SINCH_APP_ID}}",
    "recipient": {
        "contact_id": "{{YOUR_SINCH_CONTACT_ID}}"
    },
